                                <p>One possible concept to provide a uniform radial compression was inspired by an origami collapsing ninja star.This design is comprised of eight identical parallelogram shaped pieces attached together making 45°angles with each other, when all attached they make a octagon in the center.&nbsp; If each piece is moved linearly it can result radial compression. The number of components could be increased to make the aperture more circular, thus providing a more uniform force.</p>

                                <h3>Tightening Ribbon Mesh</h3>
                                <p>A concept based on providing radial force on the stent via a tightening ribbon mesh was suggested as a crimper option. For this concept, two interlocking sheets cut as to overlap and form a mesh would be wrapped around the internal chamber containing the stent. One sheet could be anchored to the bottom of the container, and the other to the top. A twisting motion on the outside of the container would change the relative positions of the two plates and therefore crimp the stent by tightening the mesh.</p>

                                <h3>Finger Trap</h3>
                                <p>This idea is inspired from the initial tightening ribbon mesh designed and inspired from Chinese New Year. There is a cylindrical tube formed from interwoven strands.The stent is placed in the middle of the tube (or trap). The ends of the trap are attached to poles at either end of the tube, these poles are sitting in a track or runway, with notches along the track. These poles are attached to a strut that is connected to a pushdown knob/handle at the top of the device. When the knob is pushed down the poles along the track are pushed outward stretching the trap and crimping the stent in the process.</p>

                                <h3>Pressure Chamber</h3>
                                <p>Another proposed concept was to use pressure to compress the stent instead of using mechanical force. This idea was loosely based on how pressure differences drive lung expansion and contraction. The stent would be surrounded by a flexible, non-permeable membrane. That membrane and stent would be within another airtight chamber. When the pressure inside that chamber increases it would have a higher presser than the insider of the stent meaning it would push inwards towards the stent. Since the chamber completely surrounds the stent and is of constant pressure it would provide uniform contractive forces 360°around the stent</p>

                                <h3> Pneumatic actuator + soft robotics</h3>
                                <p>This idea leans towards bio-mimicry and takes it inspiration from a cobra attacking its prey oran octopus twisting its tentacles. Given there is an even radial compression that is slowly in-creased and decreased in those animal. A simple press of a button would be able to increase the pressure inside the tubing that would lead to the motion of a pneumatic actuator but a set of miniature ones at that. Furthermore after coiling around the stent, the pressure would also allow the subsequent branches of the device to expand transversely. This would allow a further even yet reliant pressure on the stent, thus making sure it is properly crimped.</p>

                                <h3> Cog Design</h3>
                                <p>This design is built upon the Tightening ribbon mesh shown earlier. It focuses on the tightening mechanism for the strips. In the top right hand corner you can see two handles attached to two cylinders. The strips are fastened/attached to the rotating cylinders. As the user turns them in opposite directions the ribbons put pressure on the the crimping part of the device.</p>
